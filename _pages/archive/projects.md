### Smartphone Applications
**Easy M**
<br />Easy M is a generic app for experience sampling (ESM) research, much like its predecessors (e.g., [MyExperience](http://myexperience.sourceforge.net/)). It has been used by a variety of universities to study mood, wellbeing, anxiety, depression, and more; the app can also be used to capture behavioural data from smartphone sensors. 

**[Q Sense](http://www.qsense.phpc.cam.ac.uk/)**
<br />Q Sense was a context-aware, sensor-driven smoking cessation intervention. The app used geofencing, smoking self-reports, and a tag-based matching algorithm to deliver tailored smoking cessation support messages, and resurfaced the idea of using ratings in a health intervention. The research project that evaluated this app ran between 2013-2016. 

**Emotion Sense**
<br />Emotion Sense was a mood-tracking "journey of discovery" app. It collected manual mood reports via experience sampling and behavioural data from sensors to support research into wellbeing in daily life. This app should not be confused with the [previous research](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/emotionsense/index_prev.html) on classifying emotions from voice, which this app does not do [due to privacy concerns](https://urbanmining.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/emotion-sense-app-privacy-concerns/). The press release following the app's public launch was covered extensively (The Times, Huffington Post, BBC) and the app was subsequently downloaded over 40,000 times. The research project ran between 2011-2016. 

**The (Poo) Review**
<br />A quantified-self tool for tracking inflammatory bowel disease. This app was deployed in 2011 to test the feasibility of using ratings and implicit gamification in a health context. The results were presented at the ACM Workshop on Mobile Systems for Computational Social Science, 2012 and the 2012 ACM Recommender Systems conference.

**Tube Star**
<br />An app for crowd-sourcing status updates and disruptions in the London Underground. The app was designed following an extensive analysis of London's Oyster card data. Tube Star was deployed in 2012; the resulting research paper, reporting a thematic analysis of the content it generated, was presented at the 11th Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems, 2014.
