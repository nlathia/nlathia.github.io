🏦 I'm currently a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at [Monzo Bank](https://monzo.com/) in London, where I focus on building machine learning systems to help _make money work for everyone_ (reviewed in [2020](http://nlathia.github.io/2020/10/Monzo-ML.html), [2021](https://nlathia.github.io/2021/10/Monzo-ML.html), [2022](https://monzo.com/blog/2022/12/19/machine-learning-at-monzo-in-2022)) and Monzo's [machine learning platform](https://nlathia.github.io/2022/04/Monzo-ML-stack.html).

✈️ Before joining Monzo, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net/), where I built recommender and ranking systems to [improve travel information in the app](https://medium.com/@neal_lathia/five-lessons-from-building-machine-learning-systems-d703162846ad). 

🏫 / 📲 Before Skyscanner, I was a Senior Research Associate in the [Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/people/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working on healthcare mobile apps that use smartphone sensors. I spun out this research into a startup that was part of [Accelerate Cambridge](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/accelerate-cambridge/) in the Judge Business School.

🎓 I did an MSci in Computer Science, PhD on recommmender systems, and first postdoctoral research position on _urban data science_ in the Department of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I am still an Honorary Research Associate. While at UCL, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at [Telefonica Research](http://www.tid.es/), Barcelona and worked as a Data Science consultant.

💡 My work has always focused on systems that use machine learning - this has taken me from recommender systems to urban computing and travel information systems, digital health monitoring, smartphone sensors, banking, and open source machine learning tools. You can read more about my work and research in the [Press & Speaking](../public/) and [Research](../research/) sections.
