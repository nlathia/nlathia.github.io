🚀 I'm currently co-founder and CTO at [Gradient Labs](https://gradient-labs.ai/), which was founded in London in 2023.

🏦 I previously spent five+ years building the machine learning discipline, platform, and use cases at [Monzo Bank](https://monzo.com/) in London. I held various titles along the way, from Data Scientist through to Director of Machine Learning and Staff Machine Learning Engineer; I reviewed this journey in [2020](http://nlathia.github.io/2020/10/Monzo-ML.html), [2021](https://nlathia.github.io/2021/10/Monzo-ML.html), [2022](https://monzo.com/blog/2022/12/19/machine-learning-at-monzo-in-2022) and also wrote about Monzo's [machine learning platform](https://nlathia.github.io/2022/04/Monzo-ML-stack.html).

✈️ Before joining Monzo, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net/), where I built recommender and ranking systems to [improve travel information in the app](https://medium.com/@neal_lathia/five-lessons-from-building-machine-learning-systems-d703162846ad). 

🏫 Before Skyscanner, I was a Senior Research Associate in the [Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/people/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working on healthcare mobile apps that use smartphone sensors. I spun out this research into a startup that was part of [Accelerate Cambridge](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/accelerate-cambridge/) in the Judge Business School. You can read more about my [research](research/).

🎓 I did an MSci in Computer Science, PhD on recommmender systems, and first postdoctoral research position on _urban data science_ in the Department of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I am still an Honorary Research Associate. While at UCL, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at [Telefonica Research](http://www.tid.es/), Barcelona and worked as a Data Science consultant.
