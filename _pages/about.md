üëã Hi, I'm Neal - I'm currently the Machine Learning Lead at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) in London, where we're focusing on building machine learning systems that optimise the app and help the company scale.

‚úàÔ∏è Before joining Monzo, I was a Data Scientist at [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net/), where I built recommender and ranking systems to [improve travel information in the app](https://medium.com/@neal_lathia/five-lessons-from-building-machine-learning-systems-d703162846ad). 

üè´ Before Skyscanner, I was a Senior Research Associate in the [Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/people/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working on healthcare mobile apps that use smartphone sensors. I spun out this research into a startup that was part of [Accelerate Cambridge](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/accelerate-cambridge/) in the Judge Business School.

üéì I did my MSci, PhD, and first postdoctoral research position in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I am still an Honorary Research Associate.

My PhD focussed on methods for evaluating collaborative filtering algorithms over time. While at UCL, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at [Telefonica Research](http://www.tid.es/), Barcelona and worked as a Data Science consultant.

My work has always focused on applications that use machine learning - this has taken me from recommender systems to urban computing and travel information systems, digital health monitoring, smartphone sensors, and banking. You can read more about my work and research in the [Press & Speaking](http://nlathia.github.io/public.html) and [Research](http://nlathia.github.io/blog/research/) sections.
