üëã Hi, I'm Neal - I'm currently Director of Machine Learning at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) Bank in London, where I focus on building machine learning systems to help _make money work for everyone_ (reviewed in [2020](http://nlathia.github.io/2020/10/Monzo-ML.html), [2021](https://nlathia.github.io/2021/10/Monzo-ML.html)) and Monzo's [machine learning platform](https://nlathia.github.io/2022/04/Monzo-ML-stack.html).

‚úàÔ∏è Before joining Monzo, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net/), where I built recommender and ranking systems to [improve travel information in the app](https://medium.com/@neal_lathia/five-lessons-from-building-machine-learning-systems-d703162846ad). 

üè´ Before Skyscanner, I was a Senior Research Associate in the [Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/people/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working on healthcare mobile apps that use smartphone sensors. I spun out this research into a startup that was part of [Accelerate Cambridge](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/accelerate-cambridge/) in the Judge Business School.

üéì I did my MSci (in Computer Science), PhD (on recommmender systems), and first postdoctoral research position (on Urban Data Science) in the Department of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I am still an Honorary Research Associate.

My PhD focussed on methods for evaluating collaborative filtering algorithms over time. While at UCL, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at [Telefonica Research](http://www.tid.es/), Barcelona and worked as a Data Science consultant.

My work has always focused on applications that use machine learning - this has taken me from recommender systems to urban computing and travel information systems, digital health monitoring, smartphone sensors, banking, and open source machine learning tools (like [modelstore](https://github.com/operatorai/modelstore)). You can read more about my work and research in the [Press & Speaking](../public/) and [Research](../research/) sections.
