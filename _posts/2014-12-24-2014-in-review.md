My <a href="http://urbanmining.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/2013-in-review/" target="_blank">last year in review</a> ended with "I think that 2014 is going to be a year of prioritising and getting things finished." I think I (mostly!) managed to do just that, with most of my work this year focusing on one project, Emotion Sense. My #YearInReview:

* Most of the year was dedicated to analysing our growing <a href="http://emotionsense.org/" target="_blank">Emotion Sense</a> data and our results are now taking shape. <a href="http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/directory/gs488" target="_blank">Gillian</a> presented our first poster. There is so much more yet to come from this; I hope that my 2015 year in review will have this as its first point.
* We received a grant from the <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/rso/iaa/funding/" target="_blank">EPSRC's Impact Acceleration Follow-On Fund</a>, to help turn Emotion Sense into a <a href="http://emotionsense.com/" target="_blank">commercial product</a> for healthcare measurement, monitoring, and intervention. Emotion Sense has also been accepted as an <a href="http://iteamsonline.org/using-smartphones-to-manage-long-term-health-conditions/" target="_blank">i-Teams project</a> which will kick off in early 2015.
* We received funding from the <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Medical Research Council</a> to test and further refine <a href="http://www.qsense.phpc.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Q Sense</a>: a smoking cessation intervention that (building from Emotion Sense) uses smartphone sensing to guide quitters on a personalised, data driven journey away from tobacco. <a href="http://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/pcu-group/pcu-senior-research-staff/felix-naughton/" target="_blank">Felix</a> presented a <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nkl25/publications/posters/naughton_ehps14_poster.pdf" target="_blank">poster</a> about the project as well.
* A paper about group co-location in social networks - lead by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~clb76/" target="_blank">ChloÃ«</a> - was published in PLoS ONE (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1519" target="_blank">arxiv link</a>).
* I submitted/published a book chapter on "The Anatomy of Mobile Location-based Recommender Systems" (<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nkl25/publications/papers/lathia_recsysHB_2014.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a>) for the upcoming second version of the <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-0-387-85819-7" target="_blank">Recommender Systems Handbook.</a>
* I (finally?) published some old work from my time at UCL on crowdsourcing public transit status updates via a smartphone app (<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nkl25/publications/papers/lathia_mobiquitous2014.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>).
* <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2006/" target="_blank">Advait</a> published the results of his masters project analysing shared bicycle systems around the world in an upcoming special edition of <a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/11116" target="_blank">Transportation</a> (Special Issue on Emerging, Passively Generated Datasets for Travel Behavior and Policy Analysis).
* I gave talks in the <a href="http://sachi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/home/about/">SACHI Group</a> (University of St. Andrews), <a href="http://www.iph.cam.ac.uk/">Institute for Public Health</a> and <a href="http://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/">Dept. of Psychiatry</a> (University of Cambridge), the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pcph/research-groups-themes/e-health">E-Health Unit</a> (University College London), and the <a href="http://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/">Dept of Primary Care</a> and <a href="http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/about-us/events/">Dept. of Education</a> (University of Oxford), at <a href="http://www.health2con.com/events/conferences/health-2-0-europe-2014/" target="_blank">Health 2.0 London</a>, and at Data Science London's Healthcare hackathon. Every talk was about smartphones (e.g., these <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/neal.lathia/talk-40213834">slides</a>).
* I did less <a href="http://dataside.co.uk" target="_blank">consulting work</a> than last year, but what I am doing is more on track with my other work (... smartphones!).

I guess that the trend should continue: I hope that 2015 is going to have Emotion Sense written all over it.
