	<li>90% of apps are not used after 6 months. 80% of apps do not generate revenue to support a business. 500 million people will use a health app by 2017, a soon to be $26 billion industry. &gt;80% of surgical trainees use a mobile phone at work. Why do people not use health apps? 37% the sheer number of them is confusing. What would convince you to use a health app? 50+% if the app is free.</li>
	<li>Depression will be the largest cuse of disability by 2020 (WHO). Â£105 bn annual cost in UK. 75% of those with a diagnosable mental illness receive no treatment. People with poor mental health die 15-20 years younger.</li>

	<li>Seven deadly sins of app development: (1) inequality in app availability vs incidence of disease, (2) lack of expertise; no medical specialty involvement in app development, (3) plagerism- copying information from the web into an app, (4) commercial bias/interests- apps with no consumer reviews, promoting private practice, (5) inaccuracy and errors e.g. in <a href="http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1557488">melanoma detection</a> and <a href="http://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e32/">calculator apps</a>, (6) lack of security &amp; confidentiality, (7) lack of testing, evidence to support effect (e.g., <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001362">this review</a>, and <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle1403384">this paper</a>).</li>
