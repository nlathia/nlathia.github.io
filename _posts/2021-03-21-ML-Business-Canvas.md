These days, there are two kinds of companies who are interested in machine learning or "artificial intelligence:"

1. **_Companies that exist because of machine learning_**
<br />They are building self-driving cars, building APIs that serve predictions from their text/vision models, or building tooling and platforms for ML.
2. **_Companies that want to improve their products by using machine learning_** 
<br />These places have one or more core products already, and could try to trudge along without machine learning--but are interested in seeing how their business could change if they adopted this new technology.

Although the companies in the former group tend to get a lot of our attention, the majority of companies who are thinking about what they could do with ML fall into the second category. For them, ML could be transformative, if applied successfully (do you remember that Netflix started out as a DVD rental business, way before becoming an "[everything is a recommendation](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-1-55838468f429)" company?). And therefore, these companies need to figure out a way to identify where ML could help.

An approach that I've encountered time and again is folks proposing to use ML in a particular area _because it's possible_. I call this 'doing ML for ML's sake:' it starts with thinking about the things that ML usually does (classification, regression, ranking, etc.) and then finding problems that look like they fit with the tools in ML's toolbox. This approach is fairly widespread--even research papers do this. Unfortunately, it's also one of the reasons why I've seen Data Scientists get frustrated when their ideas are not taken up in their companies.

In the last month, I ran several ML bootcamps with a total of \~50 Data Scientists at Monzo. Since there are several great machine learning courses that are readily available online (such as [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) & [full stack deep learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/)), I decided to spend the morning session of the bootcamp talking through the questions we should answer about a project _in order to decide whether_ we should start working on it with machine learning.

Based on these sessions, I've put together a [Machine Learning Business Canvas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9LuX12vUrRE6tM_nk44vRweAhk81EM98AAxwDhU5C8/copy) Google doc; the rest of this blog post runs through the questions it has, and why they're important.
