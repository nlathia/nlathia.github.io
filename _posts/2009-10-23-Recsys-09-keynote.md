The third <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/">ACM RecSys</a> conference started today in New York; unfortunately I could not make it. However, a number of people who I follow on Twitter are there (<a href="http://twitter.com/xamat">@xamat</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/danielequercia">@danielequercia</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/barrysmyth">@barrysmyth</a>)&#8230; and are tweeting away as the conference unfolds. You can follow the stream of #recsys09 tweets <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23recsys09+OR+%23recsys">here</a>. Although I&#8217;m sure that there are many details that do not make it into the 140 character-long tweets, they provide a real time snapshot of what is going on in the conference.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/program.html#keynote">first keynote</a> has <a href="http://twitter.com/barrysmyth/statuses/5097222885">just ended</a>. <a href="http://corp.strands.com/team">Francisco Martin</a>, Founder/CEO Strands, gave a talk about the &#8220;Top 10 Lessons Learned Developing, Deploying, and Operating Real-World Recommender Systems.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the twitter summary (note: copy/pasted and lightly edited to merge similar tweets).</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 1</strong> &#8211; Make sure a recommender is really needed! Do you have lots of recommendable items? Many diverse customers?&#8230; also think Return-on-Invesment&#8230; a more <em>sophisticated</em> recommender <em>may</em> not deliver a better ROI.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2</strong> &#8211; Make sure the recommendations make <em>strategic</em> sense. Is the best recommendation for the customer also the best for the business? What is the difference between a good and useful recommendation? Good recommendations vs useful recs; Obvious recommendations may not be useful; risky recs may deliver better long-term value</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3 </strong>- Choose the right partner! Select the right rec vendor vs hire some #recsys09 students. If you are a big company the best you can do is to organize a contest</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 4</strong> &#8211; Forget about cold-start problems (!) &#8230;. just be creative. The internet has the data you need (somewhere&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 5</strong> &#8211; Get the right balance between data and algorithms. 70% of the success of a #recsys is on the data, the other 30% on the algorithm</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 6</strong> &#8211; Finding correlated items is easy but deciding what, how, and when to present to the user is hard&#8230; or dont just recommend for the sake of it. Remember user attention is a scarce and valuable resource. Use it wisely! &#8230; dont make a recommendations to a customer who is just about to pay for items at the checkout! User interface should get at least 50% of your attention.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 7</strong> &#8211; Dont&#8217;s waste time computing nearest neighbours (use social connections)&#8230; just mine the social graph. Might miss useful connections??</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 8</strong> &#8211; Dont wait to scale</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 9</strong> &#8211; Choose the right feedback mechanism. Stars vs thumbs &#8230;. the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/22/youtube-comes-to-a-5-star-realization-its-ratings-are-useless/">YouTube problem</a>. More research on implicit and other feedback mechanisms is needed. The perfect rating system is no rating system! &#8230; focus on the interface. Seems to me this is one of the gaps in current research&#8230; algorithms &gt; data &gt; interface</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 10</strong> &#8211; Measure Everything! &#8230; business control and analytics is a big opportunity here.</p>
<p><strong>Keynote Takeaway</strong> &#8211; Think about application context; Focus on interface as much as algs; Be creative with startup data. &#8230; the UI needs to get the lion&#8217;s share of the effort (50%) compared to algorithms (5%) , knowledge (20%), analytics (25%)</p>
