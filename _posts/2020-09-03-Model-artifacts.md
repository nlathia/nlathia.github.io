In this post, Iâ€™m going to zero in on the one of the smallest first steps:

# What do you do with your model artifacts?

Iâ€™ve come across many different answers here. Teams that use git lfs, cloud storage buckets, databases, and others that use email or Dropbox ðŸ˜².

Every organisation that Iâ€™ve come across, while at different stages of their own journey with machine learning, is using a slightly different ad hoc approach. Iâ€™ve built and re-built ways of doing this myself.

I would love to hear about how you do this. Feel free to hit reply and share your war stories, or jump into [this Google form](https://forms.gle/zjYeeZtFJiMhceEs9) if you wish to remain anonymous ðŸ‘€

# Model Stores

Under the hood, what weâ€™re talking about here is how you [manage your ML assets](https://www.slideshare.net/paulvermont/2018-data-engineering-for-ml-asset-management-for-features-and-models), a topic that â€” apart from this [one exploratory analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10677) I found â€” does not qualify as sexy enough for academic research.

In the open source world, there are various projects that Iâ€™ve come across â€” but never been sold on using. They enable [saving scikit-learn models](https://github.com/SohamPathak/modellogger.github.io), track [ML versions and experiment meta-data](https://github.com/VertaAI/modeldb), [decouple themselves](https://github.com/src-d/modelforge) from the libraries that we are so intimately familiar with, or [leave it up to you](https://github.com/datmo/datmo) to export the model itself.

There are some companies who are stepping into this realm, in their own way. Hugging Face has [an open model store](https://huggingface.co/models) of NLP models; DVC [enables storing models](https://dvc.org/features) using their command line tool; Google announced it will start testing a [managed service for ML assets](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/key-requirements-for-an-mlops-foundation) by the end of September. Itâ€™s a problem we all have!

# ðŸ”œ What do you need in a model store?

Last week, I spent some days off starting a Python model store library; the kind that I always wished I had. To change up from my usual lock-down routine, I even sat on a different side of the table I usually sit at while I work from home ðŸ˜…
