I';m at the <a href="http://ecmlpkdd2010.org/">2010 ECML/PKDD</a> Conference in Barcelona, Spain; I';ll be presenting a paper (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/neal.lathia/temporal-defenses-for-robust-recommendations">slides</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.lathia/papers/lathia_psdml10.pdf">paper</a>) at the Workshop on Privacy and Security in Data Mining and Machine Learning (<a href="http://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/~dimitrakakis/workshops/psdml-2010/">PSDML</a>). Check out the real-time posts on <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23ecmlpkdd2010">twitter</a> here.

Also, in a similar fashion to what Daniele did for <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2010/09/17/cikm-2010/">CIKM 2010</a>, here is a completely arbitrary, title-biased pick of papers from the conference:

* "**Demand Drive Tag Recommendation**" by G.V. Menezes, J.M. Almeida, F. Belen, M.A. Goncalves, A. Lacerda, E.S. de Moura, G.L. Pappa, A. Veloso, N. Ziviani
