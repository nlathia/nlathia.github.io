After over a year hiatus of public speaking, I gave a couple of talks about our work at Gradient Labs at the end of last year & they are now online! They cover many similar points and themes, and are two sides of the same coin: 

* How we're building for safe automation in high-stakes industries ([at @multiply.ai's workshop on AI agents in finance](https://blog.gradient-labs.ai/p/safe-ai-agents-in-high-stakes-industries)), and
* How building AI agents safely is reshaping software engineering (at the [MLOps community's conference on AI agents in production](https://home.mlops.community/public/videos/llms-and-the-rest-of-the-owl-neal-lathia-agents-in-production)).

I’ll also be speaking at the [AI Engineer London](https://luma.com/f73ey9hz?tk=GK7GC0) meetup in a couple of weeks—see you there?

No slides finalised just yet 🙈 but am planning on diving into how we’ve architected our AI agent using Go & durable execution to be evaluated and run reliably in some of the most high stakes settings. Shoot me any questions you have in this thread and I’ll try to get to them too.
