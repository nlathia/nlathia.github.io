description: The narrative of AI automation

A lot of customer support automation is framed as “AI takes the easy & repetitive parts, and opens up time for human agents to do the rest.” How might that sound if other industries used the same narrative?

* Payments: “we automate sending £10 to a friend, but for anything else talk to the bank teller”
* Healthcare: “we automate things related to the common cold, but for anything else talk to a doctor”
* AI itself: “we’re training models to be used in the most basic scenarios, but not for anything else”

Clearly doesn’t sound right. Why just CS automation? It’s certainly not the lack of opportunity or ambition. It’s not that each complex case is so unique that something like it has never been seen before. It’s not that the technology isn’t ready yet.
