Today was the long-awaited follow up to the <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2008/10/14/mobisys-ucl-and-birkbeck-research/">first introductory mobisys seminar</a>. The theme today was on the social computing research going on in the group, or, more specifically, the overlap between social and pervasive research. Only a handful of speakers gave their pitch, since we have heard from <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.quercia/">Daniele</a> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/daniele.quercia">slides</a>), <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2008/10/29/pervasive-social-computing-seminar/">Sonia</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.lathia">myself</a> in the last few weeks.

The slides from the session are below:

We followed up the pitches with a brainstorming session on the future of mobisys seminars and collaborative work. Lots of great ideas emerged: we are looking forward to incorporating them into our seminar series in the near future!
