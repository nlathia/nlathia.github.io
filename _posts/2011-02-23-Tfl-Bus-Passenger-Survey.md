After running my last online survey (read about it <a href="http://urbanmining.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/survey-londoners-how-do-you-get-around-town/">here</a>) on Londoner's trip and ticket purchasing habits, I was pointed to the fact that TfL are, themselves, doing a bit of research. They have been passing out short surveys for passengers to fill in on a number of bus routes, asking people to fill in their origins, destinations, reasons for travel.

It seems that they turned to surveys for many of the same reasons that I did: when you collect Oyster card data, you can see where people are travelling from (and, if they take the tube, where they are going to), but never understand why they are doing it. These surveys will help them get a small glimpse into why people were on buses at that time of day, and where they were going.

Thanks for the pointer (and the survey), [Tamas](http://twitter.com/jamborta).
