20th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in <a href="http://acmgis2012.cs.umd.edu/">Geographic Information Systems </a>(which will happen in November 2012 in California). Geographic Info Systems now also subsume recommender systems! Naturally, no movies here: these papers are all about location and mobility.
* Location-based and Preference-Aware Recommendation Using Sparse Geo-Social Networking Data. Jie Bao; Yu Zheng; Mohamed Mokbel
* Personalized Trip Recommendation with Multiple Constraints by Mining User Check-in Behaviors. Eric Hsueh-Chan Lu; Ching-Yu Chen; Vincent Shin-Mu Tseng
* Probabilistic Sequential POIs Recommendation via Check-In Data. Jitao Sang; Tao Mei; Jian-Tao Sun; Changsheng Xu; Shipeng Li

Reminds me of a talk I gave on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/neal.lathia/location-vs-people">location vs. people</a>. Be sure to also check out all the other <a href="http://acmgis2012.cs.umd.edu/papers">interesting papers</a> that don't have recommendation in the title.
