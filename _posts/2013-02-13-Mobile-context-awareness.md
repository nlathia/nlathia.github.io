I was invited to Gent recently to give a talk at a <a href="https://www.msec.be/mobcom/ws2013/" target="_blank">workshop on mobile research</a>. Smartphones are at the intersection of a variety of domains... from hardware to usability and machine learning. The slides below tried to capture this, and look at some recent lessons and application areas that my research is supporting.
