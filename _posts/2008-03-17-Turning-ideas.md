As the <a href="http://www.grouplens.org/node/210">GroupLens research blog</a> is reporting, MyStrands have announced a $100,000 investment for the winner of the <a href="http://www.mystrands.com/corp/strands-awards.vm">recommender startup competition</a>. The winners will be announced at <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/">RecSys 2008</a>.  On a side note, any UCL-ers interested in entrepreneurship might also be interested in <a href="http://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/courses/course-details.pht?course_ID=1020">this course</a> run by the UCL graduate school.

A new competition is adding its name to the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix prize</a>, this previous post on <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2008/03/15/evaluating-our-smart-algorithms/">evaluating algorithms with the masses</a>, and the above competition: <a href="http://www.semantichacker.com/">semantihacker</a> is offerring $1 million to anyone who can put their semantic-analysis engine to good use!
