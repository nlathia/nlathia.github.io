There's an interesting post on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/07/is-search-really-90-solved/">TechCrunch</a> based on a comment by Google's Marissa Mayer, who apparently said that search is "90-95% solved."

Regardless of the context in which this comment was made, the post's response is that the problem is not solved: it then outlines a number of areas where information retrieval has yet to succeed. However, (reminiscent of a short question that appeared in the panels of <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2007/10/23/recsys-2007/">RecSys 2007</a>) there are other questions to ask: when is ANY research question "solved?" What does it mean for a problem (like information retrieval or collaborative filtering) to be "solved?"

Thoughts?
