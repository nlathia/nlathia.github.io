The adoption of AI seems to be happening at a blinding pace. 

Thinking only about companies where AI is somewhere - e.g. hiring people.

Each type of company requires a very different persona.

# Adoption

Maturity cycle [Google whitepaper](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/ai_adoption_framework_whitepaper.pdf).

## Is it obvious yet?

One of the ways that I like to think about the adoption of AI in this first group of companies is by analogy with other technologies that sound obvious today. For example, "a company should have web site" should be a fairly uncontroversial statement to 99% of us in 2023. But then, think back to how _non-obvious_ that was to companies when the web first emerged.

The same was true for mobile apps, for (big) data, and more. The adoption of any digital technology was so non-obvious to many organisations for a long time that companies and governments had (or have!) [Chief Digital Officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_digital_officer).

These types of places may view AI as extremely promising ("we should do this!") but could ultimately continue existing - with less scale, profit, or capability - without AI. Working in AI in this environment is part evangelist (convincing people to use the AI at all), part teacher (getting people to think about what can be done with AI when framing or solving problems), and part engineer (shipping tactically).

Majority of companies 

- AI not part of the raison d'etre of the company
- But it's viewed as something incredibly powerful ("we should do this")
- Convincing people to use the technology at all
- People don't naturally think of AI when framing or solving problems
- Getting in early enough
- Majority of companies sit in this camp

## Post-adoption

- Leapfrog into the world where this is obvious
- AI wasn't part of the core of the company
- But then it was successfully introduced and has become essential
- Company's business model relies on improving these systems
- Netflix moving from DVD-in-the-post to online streaming

# Inception

## Exist because of AI

- There are some things that are possible because of AI, e.g. self-driving cars
- But potentially AI is 1 of many things the co needs to do. Wet labs.

## Infrastructure

- AI infrastructure, MLOps companies
- Exist because of AI (& challenges adopting it)
- Very little actual AI in the platform but requires knowing it

## Research labs

- Main output is research rather than products/systems;
- Do not build products, expose their 'expertise' as APIs
