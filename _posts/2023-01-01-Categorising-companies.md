Thinking only about companies where AI is somewhere - e.g. hiring people.

Each type of company requires a very different persona.

## AI transformation

- AI not part of the raison d'etre of the company
- But it's viewed as something incredibly powerful ("we should do this")
- Reminiscent of digital transformation
- Convincing people to use the technology at all
- People don't naturally think of AI when framing or solving problems
- Getting in early enough
- Majority of companies sit in this camp

## AI transformed

- AI wasn't part of the core of the company
- But then it was successfully introduced and has become essential
- Company's business model relies on improving these systems
- Netflix moving from DVD-in-the-post to online streaming

## Exist because of AI

- There are some things that are possible because of AI, e.g. self-driving cars
- But potentially AI is 1 of many things the co needs to do. Wet labs.

Also:
- AI infrastructure, MLOps companies
- Exist because of AI (& challenges adopting it)
- Very little actual AI in the platform but requires knowing it

## Research labs

- Main output is research rather than products/systems;
- Do not build products, expose their 'expertise' as APIs
