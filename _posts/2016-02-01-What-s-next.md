The past four years have been an incredible experience. The [Systems Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/) in the Computer Lab is a playground of intelligent, fun, open, curious, and driven researchers. I’ve had the chance to work with many people across the entire spectrum of the University, build systems used by thousands of people worldwide, and create incredible data sets which are likely to yield many awesome papers in the coming years.

## Amazing Mentors

A highlight of the recent months was working with the team of coaches and mentors at [Accelerate Cambridge](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/accelerate-cambridge/programmes/), in the Judge Business School. I cannot speak highly enough of this family of driven, enthusiastic, and incredibly supportive people. Working under the tutelage of coaches like Hanadi, Kaye, Chris, and Charles has been an empowering experience, and every time I walk out of the JBS I’m filled with newfound motivation for building, doing, and pursuing opportunities that lie ahead.

I’m looking forward to continuing to work with them. If you’re looking to cross paths with me in Cambridge, it will most likely be there.

## Starting, not ending
Research life doesn’t end abruptly, if it even ever ends at all. Asking questions (and buildings tools to try and answer them) is probably more of a state of mind, rather than a state of employment.

On a practical note, I’m still involved with a number of conferences and workshops; I’m still involved in papers that are under submission, or being written/revised, and I’m still collaborating with a number of researchers who are using _Easy M_ for Android. You can check out Easy M’s mailing list here (update: this mailing list no longer exists).

## Let’s connect
In the coming weeks I’ll be exploring all of the different opportunities that London has to offer, and savour my transition into the “real world.” I’m looking forward to the unknown unknowns that lie ahead, and will be using this blog to recount some highlights and tell some stories.
