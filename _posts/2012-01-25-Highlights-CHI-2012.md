The <a href="http://chi2012.acm.org/program/desktop/program.html">ACM CHI 2012 programme</a> is up. Although <a href="http://oulasvirta.posterous.com/86113982" target="_blank">1,214 papers were rejected</a> from the conference, many interesting ones seem to have made it through. As usual (for me), I've glanced through all the titles and abstracts as a first round of filtering future reading. While doing so, I categorised the titles into various groups. Here they are below: what did I miss?
