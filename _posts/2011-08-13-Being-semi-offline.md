During the past few weeks, I tried having a "worliday." It's an idea described in <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f0a90578-ba28-11e0-b313-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1UvvfgMvY">an article</a> that someone sent me (read it!). The pitch is to not go absolutely cold-turkey when you leave work (causing: worry about what is happening in your absence, the infinite pile up of e-mail that eats up so much time when you return), but instead to do a little bit that keeps you afloat each day - it claims to be particularly suited for people who have jobs that are "result-based" rather than "time-based."

In my case, this meant making sure the inbox didn't overflow, reading some papers, pitching in on last-minute changes to a paper that was submitted and, moreover, taking time to think. I would get online briefly once or twice a day, when it was too hot to be outside, instead of having a siesta.

My experience? Some aspects of this method don't work so well. Being (as) brief (as possible) in emails comes across badly. Trying to remotely manage a project doesn't work; it seems unclear to others as to whether you are away or not, and how to go about decision making in the mean time. Others are definitely great: I'm back and blogging!

Here are a number of highlights of the time I've spent catching up on tweets/posts:
<ul>
	<li>The papers that will be presented at <a href="http://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2011/acceptedpapers.html" target="_blank">ACM Ubicomp</a> (September) and <a href="http://www.recsys.acm.org/2011/accepted_papers.shtml" target="_blank">ACM RecSys</a> (October) are online.</li>
	<li>The KDD Cup workshop <a href="http://kddcup.yahoo.com/workshop.php#" target="_blank">schedule</a> is online.</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://www.occamslab.com/petricek/data/" target="_blank">paper (and data set)</a> with ratings from an online dating web site.</li>
	<li>Listen to someone put their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2_6ggJf3ns" target="_blank">foot in their mouth</a> regarding the London riots (as well as rap!). Some <a href="http://www.leonneal.com/blog/2011/08/12/london-riots-august-2011/" target="_blank">amazing pictures</a> are online as well.</li>
