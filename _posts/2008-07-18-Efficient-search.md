I read a a curious article posted on <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/07/is-the-internet.html">wired</a>: based on a recent study of journal citation patterns between '98 and '05 (that is to appear in Science), the authors claim that as the Internet provides researchers with efficient search of journal papers, "the breadth of scholarship" is being lost. Here is a quote:

> "As more journal issues came online, the articles referenced tended to be more recent, fewer journals and articles were cited, and more of the citations were to fewer journals and articles."

So, is this google scholar's fault? Is this a new trend in research? Or maybe this means that as the wealth of published research explodes, the truly cite-able papers are still few (i.e., is citation breadth a measure of quality (or not)?)

What do you think?
