I'm glad to say that the TRECK track of SAC went quite well and did not suffer from some of the things I mentioned in my previous rant. The track was organized by <a href="http://cui.unige.ch/~seigneur/">Dr. Jean-Marc Seigneur</a> of the University of Geneva, and the two sessions were chaired by <a href="http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/~virgilio">Dr. Virgilio Almeida</a> of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (who I had an interesting discussion with after the track), and was broadly divided into two themes: trust and recommender systems. The trust session had an overall focus on peer-to-peer systems, here are some quick samples:

> "Propagating Multitrust Within Trust Networks," Bistarelli/Santini

<a href="http://santini.francesco.googlepages.com/">Francesco Santini</a> presented the idea of multitrust, which aims at computing trust in a dynamically created group of trustees who all have different subjective trust values.

> "Autonomic Trust Reasoning Enables Misbehavior Detection in OLSR," Adnane/Timoteo de Sousa/Bidan/Me'

<a href="http://www.rennes.supelec.fr/ren/perso/aadnane/index_en.html">Asmaa Adnane</a> presented the application of trust to detecting misbehaviour in link-state routing algorithms. I always wonder how well these cool ideas will work in practice; if information is lost or delayed they will deduce that another node is untrustworthy!

> "Surework: A Super-peer Reputation Framework for p2p Networks," Rodriguez-Perez/Esparza/Munoz

The Surework Framework extended the current operation of trust in p2p networks to include the idea of super-peers; nodes with very high reputation can, in fact, become reputation servers.

> "CAT: A Context-Aware Trust Model for Open and Dynamic Systems" Uddin/Zulkernine/Ahamed

The CAT Model was introduced and explained- it is a model of open and dynamic systems that considers services as contexts.. The 15 minute time-limit was a bit constraining and I'll have to read the full paper!

> "Examining the Motivations of Defection in Large-Scale Open Systems," Martin-Hughes/Renz

<a href="http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/342">Rowan Martin-Hughes</a> applied a game-theoretic analysis to understand why people would defect in a large-scale open system, like eBay. The analysis was based on a modified version of the Prisoner's dilemma, which was very interesting; the only question that arises is, as <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2008/03/15/evaluating-our-smart-algorithms/">Daniele mentioned</a>, is this appropriate when users may very well behave irrationally?

The second session focused on recommender systems:

> "Tag-Aware Recommender Systems by Fusion of Collaborative Filtering Algorithms," Tso-Sutter/Marinho/Schmidt-Thieme

<a href="http://www.ismll.uni-hildesheim.de/personen/tso.html">Karen Tso-Sutter</a> presented her work on combining user-item tags into the collaborative filtering process. Interestingly, tags did not improve accuracy until the algorithm was already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting">boosted</a> by using both user- and item- based algorithms.

> "The Effect of Correlation Coefficients on Communities of Recommenders," Lathia/Hailes/Capra

<a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.lathia/publications/treck08.html">My work</a>! Looking at the similarity distribution over a graph generated by a nearest-neighbour algorithm.

> "Whom Should I Trust? The Impact of Key Figures on Cold-Start Recommendations," Victor/Cornelis/Teredesai/De Cock

<a href="http://www.cwi.ugent.be/patricia.html">Patricia Victor</a>'s paper discussed an extension to Paolo Massa's work on trust-aware recommender systems, which concluded that the cold-start problem in recommender systems can be avoided by having users express trust values in other users, which can then be propagated. The problem is: which users should they connect to? The paper has an interesting analysis of the different kind of users in the epinions dataset.

> "Comparing Keywords and Taxonomies in the Representation of Users Profiles in a Content-Based Recommender System" Loh/Lorenzi/Simoes/Wives/Oliveira

The last paper veered away from collaborative filtering to look at the role of keywords and taxonomies in content-based recommender systems. The taxonomy vs. folksonomy war continues!
