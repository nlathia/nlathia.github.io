US online DVD rental service <a title="NetFlix" href="">Netflix Inc</a> has announced a version of the  Longitude prize for film geeks &#8211; a $1m (Â£529.6m) bounty to the first  person to develop software to improve its movie recommendation system by 10%.

The full story is posted in the <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1886499,00.html">Guardian</a> and on the <a title="NetFlix Prize" href="http://netflixprize.com/index">NetFlix Prize site</a>.

The current system works by making predictions based on correlations between user feedback (as described in <a title="Jim Bennett Interview" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17587&#038;ch=biztech">this</a> interview).

I've set up a team so that i could check out the data. if anyone wants to take a look at it just let me know (even though its rather big ~665MB).
