Following Daniele's <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2008/02/08/two-great-workshops-at-itrust/">previous post</a> on workshops at iTrust, another workshop is doing its own round of advertisement: the iTrust Workshop on <a href="http://time08.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">Trust in Mobile Environments</a>. Abstracts are due the 28th of March. Here is a short description:

> Trust is a vital issue in mobile computing if applications are to support interactions which will carry data of any significance. Consider, for instance, exploring a market place: which vendors should one prefer, and why; how can a user establish the provenance of an item, etc. Various trust models have been developed in recent years to enable the construction of trust-aware applications. However, it is still not clear how robust these models are, and against what types of attacks; how accurate they are in capturing human characteristics and dynamics of trust; how suitable they are to the mobile setting. Mobility brings in orthogonal complexities to the problem of trust management: for example, the transient relationships with the environment and other users calls for an investigation of the dependency between trust and context; the lack of a clear shared control authority makes it difficult to verify identities, and to follow-up problems later; the limited network capability and ad-hoc connectivity require the investigation of novel protocols for content sharing and dissemination, and so on.
