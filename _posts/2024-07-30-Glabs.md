In the summer of 2023, I left Monzo alongside two others to start [Gradient Labs](https://gradient-labs.ai/). We're a year in and spending our time focusing on our design partners. That means that this blog has somewhat fallen by the wayside. 

⤴️  Instead, we've started co-authoring blog posts on [https://blog.gradient-labs.ai](https://blog.gradient-labs.ai/). We're writing about building AI agent(ic) systems, the problems that we're thinking about and the kinds of topics that come up on repeat with our design partners. We're blogging with Substack, so if those topics sound like they might be of interest feel free to go and subscribe over there.

I'll try to stop by and post here from time to time (not that I know whether anyone is following along here; after all, there's no way to subscribe!).
