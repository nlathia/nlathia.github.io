## About
I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) in London.

My work has always focused on applications that use machine learning; this journey has spanned digital health monitoring, smartphone sensors and applications, urban computing, recommender systems, travel information systems, and financial transactions.

Previously, I was an Senior Data Scientist at [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net), an entrepreneur in [Accelerate Cambridge](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/accelerate-cambridge/) at the Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, a Senior Research Associate in the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, a Research Associate in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at University College London, and a visiting researcher at [Telefonica Research](http://www.tid.es/). In between, I've worked as a Data Science consultant.

I have a PhD and MSci in Computer Science, both from [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/): my PhD research introduced methods for evaluating [collaborative filtering algorithms](ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) over time.
